# Perceptron Examples

This repository contains implementations of a simple perceptron and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for educational purposes.

## Contents

- **SimplePerceptron.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation of a simple perceptron for binary classification.
- **MLP.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a multilayer perceptron for multiclass classification tasks.

## Description

The perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks. This repository provides two examples:

1. **Simple Perceptron**: Introduces the basic concept of a perceptron, including the mathematical foundation and a step-by-step implementation.

2. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Extends the concept to multiple layers, demonstrating how MLPs can solve more complex problems by learning non-linear decision boundaries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gatsby0916/Neural-Network-Study-Practice.git
